Machine comprehension of Evaluative, Affective and Subjective (EAS) language on par with human understanding requires identification and understanding fine grained emotions, beliefs, opinions, and judgements expressed in language both implicitly and explicitly. The goal of this workshop is to focus the attention of NLP research community on combining deep learning statistical NLP techniques with richer/deeper semantic representations driven by computational linguistics in analysing and understanding EAS text.  This workshop is intended to throw down the gauntlet to the NLP community both in the computational linguistics camp and the deep learning camp, the challenge of understanding EAS aspects of language, on par with humans.  

We invite the NLP research community to explore approaches going beyond bag of words and bag of sentences by combining higher level linguistic insights including discourse level information, pragmatics and other contextual information along with statistical data driven techniques, for better understanding of EAS text.  Approaches which explore linguistic phenomena such as figurative language, intent detection as well as the use of extra-linguistic information in terms of the socio-cultural origins of the text, social network structure origins of the text, and author social network profiles in understanding EAS text would also be of interest. We are also interested in non-trivial EAS text applications which go beyond mere identification of evaluative, emotive, subjective cue phrases to underlying causative events/reasons/arguments which give rise to these emotions/feelings/beliefs/subjective opinions. Non-trivial benchmarks for comparing machine comprehension of EAS aspects with human understanding would also be welcome.
